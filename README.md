This prjoect would provide the details about NODE JS. Starting from the history background, we would be able to dive through all the features that NODE JS provides.



### What is NODE.Js?

Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chromeâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine.

It was created by Ryan Dahl and other developers in 2009.



### Node Core ###

**The Global Object** - Like in JavaScript we have "windows" object that is globally available, NODEJs also 
has some Global Objects that can be accessible from any location of NODEJS project. All these listed objects in the link (https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html) would be available and accessible anywhere in the project without having to require anything.
